<td>The Air Jordan 1 Retro High OG 'Chicago' 2015 colorway was designed to avoid Jordan's 
$5,000-per game fines from the NBA after the original black and red colorway was 
banned. The 'Chicago' was first retroed in 1994 and stayed true to the 1985 design. 
Further retros were released in 2013 with small changes to the design, and again in 2015 
with the original branding details: the Nike Air logo on the tongue and the original clean
heel without the Jumpman logo.</td>

<td>The Yeezy Boost 350 V2 ‘Cinder Non-Reflective’ delivers a muted colorway of Kanye
West’s popular lifestyle silhouette. A charcoal grey hue is applied throughout the
Primeknit upper, accented with the standard post-dyed monofilament stripe on the
sneaker’s lateral side. The same dark grey coloring is used on the rubber cage that
encapsulates the Boost midsole, while the outsole is rendered in grippy gum rubber.
Underfoot, an unexpected pop of bright yellow distinguishes the heel pod.</td>

<td>The Nike women’s Dunk Low ‘Coast’ highlights traditional two-tone color blocking on a
leather upper that maintains the look of the original 1985 release. A crisp white base,
replete with perforated detailing on the toe box, is contrasted by overlays in a vibrant
blue finish. Nike branding on the heel tab and woven tongue tag are rendered in an
unexpected pop of yellow. The sneaker rides on a low-profile midsole, supported by a
rubber outsole featuring concentric circle tread.</td>
